Practice Lox is like the name says, a practice programming language to learn how the languages works from inside and the algorithms they use to work.
I'm using the [Crafting interpreter](https://craftinginterpreters.com/index.html) book to learn how to actually build a language and in the book the name for the language that the author build is `Lox`, thats why I use `ox` for mine.
